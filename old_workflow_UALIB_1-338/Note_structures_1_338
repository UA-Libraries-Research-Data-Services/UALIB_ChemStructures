# When we started this indexing project, we experimented with several different 
workflows.

Structures UALIB_1 through UALIB-338 were compiled in either ChemDraw for Excel
or ChemAxon for MS Excel. The compiled structures, associated identifiers, and 
bibliogrpahic data were then exported as an SDfile from the Excel plugins. We
have included the original data as a tab text file.
