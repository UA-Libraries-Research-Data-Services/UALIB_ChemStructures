# UALIB_ChemStructures
Chemical Substances from The University of Alabama Dissertations and Theses

## What is this?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository contains machine-readable registered (converted to machine format and checked for uniqueness) chemical substances (non-standardized) from The University of Alabama Dissertations and Theses (hereafter, theses). The chemical data in this repository are working temporary files, and non-standardized chemical structure and related data that we created during the project. As such, it is **not recommended** to use any of this repository data. We recommend downloading the University of Alabama Libraries chemical structure data from PubChem as PubChem handles the standardization (within the Compound database) of the chemical structures:[The University of Alabama Libraries PubChem Data Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/source/15645). This repository is useful to understand our [workflow](https://github.com/UA-Libraries-Research-Data-Services/UALIB_ChemStructures/blob/master/workflow_and_file_overview.md), and read our notes on [copyright and reuse](https://github.com/UA-Libraries-Research-Data-Services/UALIB_ChemStructures?tab=readme-ov-file#notes-on-copyright-and-reuse). 

**There are currently ~3000 chemical substances registered across 73 theses**

Chemical structure data includes the name (or ID), SMILES, and InChI of synthesized chemical
substances within the thesis along with a permalink to the thesis full-text or catalog link (if not yet available online), Moreover, an SDfile containing the connection table, name (or ID), SMILES, InChI, citation, permalink, and local structure registry ID is included.

## Notes on Copyright and Reuse

**Disclaimer: Not legal advice, just our own personal (non-lawyer) thoughtful notes.**

The purpose of The University of Alabama Dissertation and Thesis Substance Registration project 
is to allow greater discovery, use, and credit of the original authors' theses, 
not to claim any ownership of the written thesis content. The thesis authors hold the 
copyright to their own thesis.

***For all substances and associated data extracted and registered: no judgment is made on the appropriateness of the synthetic method reported, safety precautions required, nor accuracy of the characterization data. Readers need to make their own assessment of the authors claims, procedures, and necessary safety precautions.***

*During extraction, registration and processing of the chemical substances and related data, inaccuracies may be present due to human and/or machine software error. We attempted to minimize inaccuracies and share chemical substances and related data with fidelity to the original thesis. Moreoever, we can not make any guarantees on the accuracy of the chemical structure data, chemical names, and other associated data from the theses. You should always check the original thesis reference to verify the data, as well as check other relevant information sources.*

We have only extracted and shared scientific facts (i.e., the chemical substances) and bibliographic
information from the theses. Such scientific facts and bibliographic data are not subject 
to U.S. copyright protection: 
[Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices](https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/).
See specifically section 313.3(A), where examples are listed that are excluded 
from copyright protection, one of which includes chemical substances:

..."DNA sequences and other genetic, biological, or chemical substances or 
compounds, regardless of whether they are man-made or produced by nature..."

We have endeavored to credit each thesis author respectfully by including a citation reference and permalink (where possible) on all shared chemical structure data including within
this Git Repository data files, The University of Alabama Institutional Repository,
and PubChem Substance Pages.

Our intention is for you to reuse the chemical structure data 
however you like. All chemical structure and associated data in this repository is licensed 
with [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Please give the 
original authors of the theses credit by citing their work and following 
standard scholarly practice for reuse of the scientific literature, 
particularly if the data has led you to useful content within their 
thesis (as noted above, each thesis Author holds their own copyright). If you are
reusing a large corpus of the structures as a dataset, then it is appreciated 
if you cite our work as we put the effort into the data compilation. Lastly, any code in this repository is licensed under the BSD-2 license.
